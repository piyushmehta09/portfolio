   - Animates from top to bottom
   - Removes completed animations

3. **Continuous Generation**
   - Every 2 seconds, new line appears
   - Keeps background dynamic
   - Never stops (until page close)

4. **Visual Layers**
   ```
   Layer 1: Gradient mesh (depth)
   Layer 2: Grid pattern (structure)
